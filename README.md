# NodeJS Layered App

This repository is a working example of a layered application implemented in NodeJS, my focus here is to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of this approach, walking the reader through each layer and explaining the rationale behind each design decision.

The project is structured in the following way:
```mermaid
graph TD;
      A-->B;
      A-->C;
      B-->D;
      C-->D;
```
